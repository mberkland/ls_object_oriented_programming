# How do we create an object in Ruby? Give an example of the creation of an
# object.

# Objects are created from classes. Classes are like molds and objects are
# things produced from those molds. Attributes and behaviors for objects are
# defined in classes.

# To define a class you say:

class ClassName # make sure the name of the class is CamelCase

end


new_object = ClassName.new

# new_object is now a new object or instance of ClassName
